# Blockchain_Polgon_Indexer-Task-2

A real-time blockchain data indexing system that monitors the Polygon network for POL token transfers involving **Binance exchange addresses**.
The system extracts transfer logs, persists them into a SQLite database, maintains cumulative netflow metrics **(inflow â€“ outflow)**, and provides a REST API and CLI for querying.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-Time Indexing â€“ Processes live blocks from Polygon WebSocket RPC.

- Targeted Monitoring â€“ Tracks POL token transfers with Binance hot wallets.

- SQLite Database Storage â€“ Persists raw transfers and cumulative netflow.

- Cumulative Netflow Metric â€“ Continuously updated inflow/outflow value.

- CLI Query Tool â€“ Fetch latest netflow directly from terminal.

- REST API Endpoints â€“ Access cumulative netflow via HTTP.

- Configurable via .env â€“ Database path, contract address, Binance addresses, RPC endpoint.
